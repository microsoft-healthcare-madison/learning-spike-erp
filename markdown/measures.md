## Definitions
* Ventilator:
Any device used to support, assist or control respiration (inclusive of the weaning period) through the application of positive
pressure to the airway when delivered via an artificial airway, specifically an oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.
Note: Ventilation and lung expansion devices that deliver positive pressure to the airway (for example: CPAP, BiPAP, bi-level, IPPB and
PEEP) via non-invasive means (for example: nasal prongs, nasal mask, full face mask, total mask, etc.) are not considered ventilators
unless positive pressure is delivered via an artificial airway (oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube).
* Beds:
Baby beds in mom's room count as 1 bed, even if there are multiple baby beds
Follow-up in progress if staffed is less than licensed.
Total includes all beds, even if with surge beds it exceeds licensed beds.
* ICU beds:
Include NICU (from CDC Webinar 31-Mar-2020) (outstanding question on burn unit)
